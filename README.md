# FriendFinder

This is the 10th homework assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

For this assignment, we were asked to create a compatibility-based FriendFinder.  This application asks users to take a 10-question survey and then compares their answers to other users to find the best match.

Take the survey and you will be able to see the user whose answers most similarly matched your own. 

Please note, all fields are required!
